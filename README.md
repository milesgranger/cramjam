### Install
```commandline
pip install --upgrade cramjam  # Requires no Python or system dependencies!
```

---

Extremely thin Python bindings to de/compression algorithms in Rust.
Allows for using algorithms such as Snappy, without any system dependencies.

This is handy when being used in environments like AWS Lambda, where installing
packages like `python-snappy` becomes difficult because of system level dependencies.

---

##### Benchmarks

Some basic benchmarks are available [in the benchmarks directory](./benchmarks/README.md)

---

Available algorithms:

- [X] Snappy
- [X] Brotli
- [X] Bzip2
- [X] Lz4
- [X] Gzip
- [X] Deflate
- [X] ZSTD

All available for use as:

```python
>>> import cramjam
>>> import numpy as np
>>> compressed = cramjam.snappy.compress(b"bytes here")
>>> decompressed = cramjam.snappy.decompress(compressed)
>>> decompressed
cramjam.Buffer(len=10)  # an object which implements the buffer protocol
>>> bytes(decompressed)
b"bytes here"
>>> np.frombuffer(decompressed, dtype=np.uint8)
array([ 98, 121, 116, 101, 115,  32, 104, 101, 114, 101], dtype=uint8)
```

Where the API is `cramjam.<compression-variant>.compress/decompress` and accepts 
`bytes`/`bytearray`/`numpy.array`/`cramjam.File`/`cramjam.Buffer` objects.

**de/compress_into**
Additionally, all variants support `decompress_into` and `compress_into`. 
Ex.
```python
>>> import numpy as np
>>> from cramjam import snappy, Buffer
>>>
>>> data = np.frombuffer(b'some bytes here', dtype=np.uint8)
>>> data
array([115, 111, 109, 101,  32,  98, 121, 116, 101, 115,  32, 104, 101,
       114, 101], dtype=uint8)
>>>
>>> compressed = Buffer()
>>> snappy.compress_into(data, compressed)
33  # 33 bytes written to compressed buffer
>>>
>>> compressed.tell()  # Where is the buffer position?
33  # goodie!
>>>
>>> compressed.seek(0)  # Go back to the start of the buffer so we can prepare to decompress
>>> decompressed = b'0' * len(data)  # let's write to `bytes` as output
>>> decompressed
b'000000000000000'
>>>
>>> snappy.decompress_into(compressed, decompressed)
15  # 15 bytes written to decompressed
>>> decompressed
b'some bytes here'
```

**Special note!**  
If you know the length of the de/compress output, you
can provide `output_len=<<some int>>` to any `de/compress`
to get ~1.5-3x performance increase as this allows single 
buffer allocation; doesn't really apply if you're using `cramjam.Buffer`
or `cramjam.File` objects.
